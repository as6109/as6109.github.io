		<p>Scars are an important symbol in the Avatar universe. Both <a href="https://i.redd.it/dlidgof6nj711.png">Aang</a> and Zuko are scarred, yet it is Zuko's that represents the cruel violence of the Fire Nation <em>(and his family)</em>. It is a physical reminder, not of the honor he thought he lost, but of who he is: a child who suffered abuse, and a boy who defied his nation to stay true to his beliefs.</p>
